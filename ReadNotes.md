before starting developing
a project setup is done before to avoid some problems during devlopement phase,

-in the project setup part,things i get to know about are

-.gitkeep file - used to track empty folders

-dev dependencies - dependencies used only during development phase.

-prettier -this helps avoid conflicts when working in a team, configure basic format. 

-mongo db uri ending slash can create problems so remove slash\

-use try/catch and async await while connecting to database

-give proper error name, so it is easier to debug later and save some time.
